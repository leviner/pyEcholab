This script demonstrates using the echosounder module to reading a raw file
and plot Sv echograms.

The echosounder module provides a simplified interface for reading raw data
generated by EK60, EK80, and similar instruments. Due to the wide variety of
instruments that utilize the Simrad "raw" data format and their many configuration
options, pyEcholab's classes for working with these data are complex. The
echosounder module makes a few assumptions that are applicable to most use
cases that significantly reduces this complexity.



Until better documentation is created, here are the highlights of the
processed_data object.

Attributes

bottom_line - an pyEcholab.line object containing the bottom detections
channel_id - a string containing the channel name
data - the attribute that contains the sample data - processed_data objects also
       have a reference to the data named for the data type, so Sv data will also
       have an attribute "Sv" that points to this data.
data_type - a string specifying the data type: Sv, sv, Sp, sp, power, etc
depth - contains the vertical axis values in meters when the vertical axis is specified as depth
 OR
range - contains the vertical axis values in meters when the vertical axis is specified as range
frequency - the frequency of the sample data
heading - contains the platform heading data by ping
heave - contains the platform heave data by ping
is_heave_corrected - will be True if heave correction has been applied to the data
is_log - Will be True if data are in log form
latitude - contains the latitude data by ping
longitude - contains the longitude data by ping
n_pings - contains the number of pings in the data
n_samples - contains the number of samples in the data
ping_time - contains the ping times as a numpy datetime64 object
pitch - contains the platform pitch data by ping
sample_interval
sample_offset - the number of samples the data have been offset vertically
sample_thickness - the thickness, in meters, of each sample
sound_speed
spd_over_grnd_kts
transducer_offset
trip_distance_nmi


Methods

get_v_axis - return the vertical axis and the axis type (range or depth)
heave_correct - apply heave correction
match_pings
match_samples
to_depth - convert the vertical axis to depth
to_linear - convert the dat to linear form
to_log - convert the data to log form
to_range - convert the vertical axis to range
